My aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets â€“ for instance for a software development company.

Working for such a (for now imaginary ;-)) company, my job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.

This project functioned under the premiss that this company only builds apps that are free to download and install, and its main source of revenue consists of in-app ads.

This means that the revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help the developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.
